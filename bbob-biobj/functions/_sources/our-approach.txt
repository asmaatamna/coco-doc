Overview of the Proposed ``bbob-biobj`` Test Suite
==================================================

will go here:

- 55 functions in any dimension
- combining well-known single-objective functions
- designed to represent typical difficulties of real-world problems
- idea of instances
- ideal and nadir point known, hence possible to normalize functions for performance assessment; the functions, as
  shown to the algorithms, however, will typically show different orders of magnitude between the two objective values
